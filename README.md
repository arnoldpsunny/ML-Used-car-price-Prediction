Predicting  the  price of a used cars has been studied extensively in various  researches.Car price prediction is somehow an interesting and popular problem.Accurate car price prediction involves expert knowledge, because price  usually depends on many  distinctive  features  and factors.Typically, the most signiÔ¨Åcant ones are present price , brand and model,  age, mileage etc. The fuel type used in the car as well as fuel consumption  per mile highly affect the price of a car due to a frequent changes in the  price of a fuel.
Different features like  Transmission, tax, Mileage per gallon (mpg), engine size , etc. will also inÔ¨Çuence the car price.

    o       Analysed the data, performed univarient and bivarient analysis . 
    
    o	Found out the correlation between various variables by using Pearson Correlation coefficient and also plotted heatmap of it.
           
            Eg: PCC of Year and Price 
            
            Pearson Correlation coefficient :  0.58

     
    o	Created different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest,Support Vector  Machine .
  
    o	Random forest with hyper parameter tuned using grid search cv gives the maximum accuracy of 92.3%. 
    
    o	Most of the regression models gives good predictions

    1. Imported the data into python dataframe.
    
    2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
    
    3. The data consists of nearly about 4200 car data.
    
    4. Performed univarient and bivarient analysis.
    
    5. Ploted the  necessary graphs.
    
    6. Created different Machine Learning Models.
    
    7. Calculated the accuracy using rmse,r2 score etc .
    
    8. The random forest model gave an accuracy of 92.3%.
    
    9. Created a powerpoint presentation with all the insights and conclusions listed with the indepth analysis.

# Conclusions

Predicted the car price for the used cars in UK.

Random Forest model gave the maximum accuracy.

It can also be implemented in different car rendals and second hnd market in India.
